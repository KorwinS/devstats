      "body": "The existing PhoneNumber provider does not fully implement the [NANP rules for area codes](https://www.nationalnanpa.com/area_codes/index.html). This can be problematic when running generated phone numbers against validation.\r\n\r\nIn concert with implementing the full NANP rules, this PR modifies randomDigitNot() such that it will accept an array as an argument. If you prefer, we could implement a distinct method such as randomDigitNotIn() instead. I did this because the first and second digits of the area code cannot be 37 or 96, so passing [3,7] or [9,6] was more convenient.",
