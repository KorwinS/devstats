That'd be the best of both worlds.\r\n\r\nCould we instead do the opposite? If I'm not mistaken, it's common practice to log informational output to `stderr` if `stdout` will be used for e.g. piping.\r\n\r\nHere's one nice blog post summarizing what I've understood `stderr` and `stdout` should be used for: https://www.jstorimer.com/blogs/workingwithcode/7766119-when-to-use-stderr-instead-of-stdout\r\n\r\n",

This is extremely useful for piping into files which can then be uploaded to web-based [bundle](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer) [analysis](https://github.com/webpack/analyse) [tools](http://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/).\r\n\r\nIt would be great if webpack-command could support this flag or something equivalent -- perhaps through a reporter. Since webpack-command is already working with the JSON stats, I assume this would be a low-overhead feature to support.\r\n\r\nI'm about to take a vacation but I might be able to get a PR out before I leave if this sounds reasonable to you.\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nThere is currently no way to get the build stats as JSON.\r\n\r\n### New Feature Use Case\r\n\r\nSee expected behavior above.",
